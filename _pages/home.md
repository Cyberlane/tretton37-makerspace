Slowly , but surely we are beginning to build our own Makerspace within tretton37\. Our very first bit of hardware has arrived, the [Ultimaker 2](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-2-family/ultimaker-2). Like all tools, there are correct ways to use them, and incorrect ways to use them.

This repository will serve as a simple GitHub Jekyll Pages website with usage information, instructions, safety, and everything else related to the company Makerspace. Pull requests are **very** welcome, to extend the information on here, fix spelling/grammar, or even to improve some webpage styling. We are in this together, so let's help each other out!
