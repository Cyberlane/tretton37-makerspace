### What is a 3D Printer

What is this crazy magic, some of you may be asking, well simply put it is just a machine that takes some plastic (PLA or ABS), and melts it into the shape of a 3D object that you provide to it, very much the way that a regular printer takes pictures and draws those on paper, this is just adding an extra dimension. If you need to know more beyond that about how they work, there is plenty of information all over the web about it.

### Which printer have we got?

 We have the Ultimaker 2!

### How to use the printer

 The 3D printer has an SD Card and a USB Cable, however the USB cable is in fact a serial interface (extremely slow). If you print with the USB you **HAVE TO** keep your laptop/computer connected at all times until the print job completes, otherwise it will fail.

### Benefits of using the USB interface

 You gain some statistics whilst it is connected this way, such as the heat of the bed (what it prints onto) and the nozzle (the bit that melts the plastic), along with fan speeds, and other things that are useful to know if you are debugging an issue. Most of the time you do not need these features, so really it is best to load your file onto the provided SD card (or your own) and print from that, so you can continue using your computer for work (damn lazy ninjas).

 The other reason to make use of the USB interface would be to update the firmware on the 3D printer from time to time.

### Keeping the 3D printer clean

We need to buy some acetate or some other type of spirit to clean glass as you have to use paper glue on the glass just before printing to form the first contact's ability to stick down. It should be simple enough to clean, but we could do with something for it, kept nearby so people cannot be lazy and avoid cleaning up after themselves!

Keep some paper towel nearby to clean the nozzle after you first feed in filament and again after you are finished printing (if there is any left on there), however avoid touching it with your bare heads (as it is bloody hot) and do not wait for it to cool down as it will stick like cement.

**DO NOT** put any metallic or sharp objects need the glass, it is glass, it can scratch and if you damage the glass, the printer quality will suffer! I recommend we buy a sturdy plastic tool (similar to one of those things you use to change an iPhone screen) to pry off completed print jobs, which will not scratch the glass and will help you get your stuff off of the printer.

### Leveling the bed

You should not need to level the bed again (I have already done it) unless the printer is physically moved, and this does not include nudging it slightly to change the filament (the plastic stuff that you melt). In general, don't touch this setting unless something is wrong, at which point, stop the printer and run through the calibration wizard, it takes 5-10 minutes depending on how good your eyes are!


### Changing and/or removing the filament

To remove the filament, you need to tell it so via the menu on the printer, and it will rewind what it has, ask you to turn off the print, and you can then manually pull the remainder out by hand. It may seem a little tough, but that is normal! To insert new filament, select the option on the printer's menu and follow the instructions. It requires a little force for the first couple cm, but after that it should handle it by itself. Make sure before you feed in the filament that there are NO bends in the tip of the filament, because this will just jam in the printer, so cut them off!

### What filament we have right now (6/8/15)

Grey (ABS)
Black (ABS)
Dutch Orange (PLA)

Coming soon...
Ninja Flex Green (PLA)

### What's the difference between PLA and ABS?

ABS has a melting point of around 165 degrees, whilst PLA is only 115 degrees.

ABS can also melt with acetate (nail polish remover), so if you want to polish your models to have a nice glossy finish you could use a little on a cloth and do just that, but be careful as too much and it will in fact dissolve your work!

### Open a window!

You do not really get any smoke or smell from the printer when you are doing a small job, however it does get really warm, so it is recommended to open the window before you start and to obviously close it before you leave the office!

### Never leave the printer alone for too long

When printing, it is recommended that you watch it print the first few layers before you leave it alone to do it's thing, as if it is going to screw up, it will do so on the first few layers (generally something will get caught on the head and it will drag it around, ruining your model). Once it is printing all okay for the first few layers you can leave it alone, but it is recommended (since it is a fire hazard) to keep an eye on it every 15-20 minutes to make sure it is okay.

### What's that weird noise?

If you hear a weird grinding noise, that means it is struggling with feeding in the filament - this is normal when you are first feeding in some new filament and you generally solve it by forcing the filament up by hand until it begins to melt out of the nozel, do not worry you will not break the printer doing this. This should not happen when you are printing, however if it does you use the middle sized allen key on the bolt on the top of the extruder (the black thing you put the filament into), to tighten and loosen the grip accordingly which should solve this issue. I have calibrated this already, so it should not need to be touched unless over time it becomes loose, OR you begin to use a different sized filament from what we have right now (2.85mm I believe).
